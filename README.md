# Medical-Solutions-Comprehensive-Drug-Recommendation-for-Accurate-Prescriptions

This is a machine learning project designed to build a decision support system for personalized drug recommendations based on patient data. By leveraging historical patient data and their responses to different medications, this project employs a Decision Tree classification algorithm to predict the most suitable drug for new patients. The system aims to enhance the precision and efficacy of medical prescriptions, thereby improving patient outcomes and optimizing healthcare delivery.
